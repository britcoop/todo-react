# React to-do app

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed on your environment.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v8.9.4

    $ npm --version
    5.7.1

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew install node

#### Node installation on Windows

Just go on [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) & grab the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it.
